<h2>This is V1 of the Trend Analytics Order Macro Chrome Extension</h2>
<br>
<br>
This is only a basic version that helps place orders in Webull webview based on entries typed out in the discord chat.
<br>
<br>
How to use it:
<br>
<br>
-Highlight an entry text that has a clearly defined ticker and entry price (e.g "LFWD took some @ $1.7s. S/L under $1.60.")
<br>
-Right click the text and click "Send stock quote to Webull"
<br>
-This will open up webull in a new tab and voila
